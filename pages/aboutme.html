                        Outside of research, I have a number of hobbies and pastimes. I enjoy reading and learning about 
                        philosophy, playing and listening to music, exploring the outdoors, and photographing nature. I 
                        have numerous philosophy books, which is the main genre I read. You can learn more about my 
                        favorite philosophers and thinkers on the Philosophy page. I am also a musician and I can play 
                        the guitar, bass guitar, piano, drums, and some more unique instruments like the ukulele, the 
                        harmonica, and the ocarina. My main instrument is the bass guitar and it's my favorite because 
                        it is a musical coupling that links the melodic and rhythmic parts of multi-instrumental 
                        composition. I enjoy going on hikes as well, mainly within the Ramapo Valley County Reservation 
                        located in Mahwah, New Jersey. When on these hikes, I enjoy photographing anything interesting I 
                        see such as unique insects, birds, plants, or any type of life, unique geological formations, 
                        and beautiful views that are found along the way.

                        Another source of joy in my life is the fact I get to live it with my dog Zeno by my side. He is
                         a purebred standard schnauzer and also my best friend. He is energetic and such a sweet and 
                         loving dog. He is incredibly smart and I have trained him since he was just 10 weeks old. I 
                         enjoy running with him and watching him live and be a dog. He enjoys hiking just as much as me 
                         (if not more). I named him after Zeno of Citium who was the founder of the Stoic school of 
                         philosophy. He looks like an ancient Greek philosopher with his long beard and eyebrows and 
                         silver hair that brings to mind one of profound wisdom and insight.
