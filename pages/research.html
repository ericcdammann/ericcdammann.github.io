                        The goal of my research is to better understand how carbon moves throughout space
                        and time by physical, biological, and chemical processes within tidal marsh ecosystems. 
                        The methodology of my research involves the development of numerical models that provide mechanistic insight into
                        how these processes affect the spatial and temporal distribution of carbon and how the carbon
                        cycling system functions as a whole within these ecosystems. I parameterize these models with
                        field, lab, and historical environmental and GIS data and validate them with those same types
                        of data and statistical analysis.

                        The carbon cycle in tidal marsh ecosystems is so complex and variable and can not be
                        perfectly described by models within our current understanding and computational abilities.
                        However, with the development of models that concentrate on unclear processes and idealize
                        and simplify other processes that are better understood a more acute understanding of those
                        unclear processes can develop. What was once veiled in confusion can now be articulated and
                        data can be better explained. This is what I hope to acheive.
