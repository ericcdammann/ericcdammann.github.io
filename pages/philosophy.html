                        For me, it all starts with Plato, the ancient Greek philosopher. His idea, that the apparent 
                        world of matter that is known by the senses and is in constant flux, is actually just a distorted 
                        picture of the real world, a world of Forms, has always been intuitive and reasonable to me. 
                        These Forms are the non-physical, timeless, absolute, and unchangeable essences of all 
                        things. This is important because scientists are generally materialists while I consider myself an 
                        idealist. I am using the term idealist in the broadest sense, meaning that I think matter can be 
                        explained by the mind but that mind cannot be explained by matter and that mind and matter 
                        are separate and distinguishable things. This is a metaphysical position that runs contrary to 
                        that of most scientists, who think that matter is preeminent and does (or will eventually) explain 
                        the mind. I accept my position because of many convincing arguments sourced from my 
                        epistemological influence from Plato who held to a position of rationalism, which is the idea that 
                        our knowledge is chiefly sourced by reason independent of sensory perception.

                        Many mathematicians take this position, and it is one that seems to be intuitive to me. It 
                        explains why my focus in science is on the application of mathematics to represent the physical 
                        world and its many processes. I understand there are many convincing and problematic arguments 
                        against this position I hold, I am not ignoring them but, despite them, I still think that this 
                        epistemic and metaphysical position is the best picture of reality or at the very least the best 
                        systematic lens for looking at reality. These ideas have helped me as a scientist and mathematician 
                        to see things from a new and fresh angle and to progress in life as a human being as well. I think 
                        often about how things came to be, what things actually are, and how we can know anything about our 
                        world. I also am interested in the mind body-problem, i.e. the relationship between the conscious 
                        mind and the body. I appreciate the challenges brought on by those who think differently than me 
                        and that constant feedback allows me to adapt and question my own views to learn more.

                        Thomas Aquinas, who was a medieval Christian theologian and philosopher, is another important 
                        influence on my thought. Thomas Aquinas was also a rationalist and an idealist but he mainly 
                        influenced me in my motivation and desire to study the world. He thought that we could have an 
                        ideal grasp on some subject (this ideal grasp he called scientia). He believed having scientia 
                        meant having knowledge about the essence of the things within a subject. Since we can know about 
                        the essence of things, he reasoned that we can thus discern universal truths about those things and 
                        understand the underlying cause of why those things exist as they do. This is a bit abstract but in 
                        simple terms it is the idea that there is the potential to know all things about a subject, including 
                        the metaphysical basis nearly every member of the human race is pinning for, knowledge of the divine.

                        Aquinas famously offered his five ways to demonstrate the existence of God through God's effects 
                        which he reasoned are well known to us. While I am skeptical of the ability to demonstrate absolutely 
                        the existence of the classical interpretation of the Christian god (which Aquinas agrees to as well), 
                        I think that while each individual argument of the five is not very strong, together they raise a 
                        good argument for the existence of a first-mover cause of pure eternal actuality. I think the point 
                        of theology is to think about this “first-mover cause of pure eternal actuality” and what it would be 
                        like, and I personally do so within the Lutheran tradition. This has had a positive effect on my life 
                        and increased my sense of wonder as a scientist and a mathematician. The work of Aquinas has 
                        encouraged me to more often sit and ponder on these ideas that are hard to articulate yet seem so 
                        universal. Just taking time to think about them has been helpful, regardless of whether that time 
                        thinking leads to a concrete conclusion.

                    <p>
                        I do however want to offer up one criticism of Aquinas which is a lesson on how not to do philosophy. 
                        He seems to switch between appealing to philosophy and divine revelation as an origin of knowledge. 
                        He was a theologian after all so being wrong about the classical Christian conception of God was not 
                        an option to him so oftentimes he started his thoughts with a conclusion, took philosophy as far as 
                        he could to explain the conclusion, and then filled in the explanatory gap with divine revelation. 
                        This is not something that should be done in my opinion and limits the conversations that can be had 
                        about a subject.

                        Following Aquinas, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was another person of great influence. He was a 17th 
                        century German mathematician and philosopher who was astoundingly brilliant. He is known for 
                        developing differential and integral calculus independently of Issac Newton who lived during the same 
                        time. Philosophically, he was also an idealist and a rationalist, but he is on my list for his 
                        influence on the field of mathematics and logic mainly, his use of modal terminology way before modal 
                        logic became the developed field it is today. He was one who believed that we could understand the 
                        world. He explored areas of mathematics, philosophy, theology, ethics, politics, law, history, music, 
                        and many other subjects during his lifetime. Not only did he learn about each of these fields he 
                        contributed to them and his effect is known even in modern day.

                    <p>This to me is a lesson, one I try to learn from as I live. I love to learn to read about everything 
                        and everything and try to take an interdisciplinary approach to every question. The more I can 
                        learn and know, the better ethical person I can be. In this sense, Leibniz has been a figure of 
                        inspiration for me which has encouraged me to, despite all the horrid things in this world, 
                        investigate every crevice of it and see what knowledge I can find. He also was a trinitarian 
                        Christian and argued that the reason God created this world is because it was the “best” possible 
                        world he could create. I disagree with Liebniz’s formulation of this argument, but I see many 
                        people today beginning to accept that this world is not that great and, perhaps, some hope that 
                        this world is, at the very least, one of the best possible worlds is a beneficial belief to hold 
                        and I think there is sufficient reason to hold it.

                    <p>
                        Thus far I hope I have presented a beautiful and connected line of thought originating in Plato, 
                        with certain insights being added by Aquinas, and a practical application of these ideas by 
                        Liebniz. These patterns of thought can be recognized in nearly every intellectual tradition in 
                        history at larger and smaller spatial scales. It was Hegel, a 19th century German philosopher, 
                        who saw these patterns and was motivated to devise a teleological account of all of human history 
                        (teleological meaning explaining the reason as a function of its end). He proposed in an all 
                        encompassing philosophical system that history was a dialectical process and picture of the 
                        evolution of consciousness which culminates in what he called “Absolute Spirit”. This dialectical 
                        process involves a notion or idea being presented and when challenged (negated), instead throwing 
                        the original notion away as was common in Plato's dialectics, both the notion and its negation 
                        should be coalesced into a new superior notion that preserves both the original notion and its 
                        negation within it. This new superior notion will in turn create new negations and thus the 
                        process continues until the absolute whole truth is reached. Hegel applied this to human 
                        consciousness and proposed that at a given time consciousness knows something about itself, yet 
                        what it knows is not the object of the knowledge and thus is distinguished. There will be a 
                        contradiction between what consciousness knows and the object of the knowledge which negates what 
                        it knows, and there will thus be an elevated version of consciousness afterwards. As this process 
                        repeats itself, he reasoned that the end of this process would lead to “Absolute Knowing” which 
                        he thought could be achieved by humans.

                        I think Hegel's ideas are extremely interesting. I am constantly working through them and seeing 
                        how they all connect. I think the idea that to progress to a new level of consciousness requires 
                        interaction and mingling with the consciousness of others to progress on our own, is a universally 
                        true statement. Can we ever truly understand the object of our knowledge? Hegel thought so, I 
                        hopefully agree. I think that is a good belief to hold. Hegel may have been a bit over ambitious 
                        in trying to capture all of life's questions in one system but his ideas about the mind have 
                        helped me in dealing with others and learning from others as well. His ideas have also helped me 
                        to adapt how I present science to my audience and how to do so effectively.

                        The last of the influences on my list is Kurt Friedrich Gödel, the 20th century logician. Seemingly 
                        the opposite of Hegel in some ways, his main contribution to my thought has been his incompleteness 
                        theorems. He showed that for any given consistent formal system, within which a sufficient amount 
                        of mathematics can be done, there are statements of the language of that system that can be neither 
                        proved nor disproved within the system. His second incompleteness theorem showed that within a 
                        given consistent formal system, it can not be proved within the system that it is consistent 
                        (assuming that it is). This leads to the idea that mathematics will always have at least one true 
                        statement that will be unprovable. There also are false statements that will be unable to be proved 
                        so. These theorems are only shown to be true for formal systems of mathematics but it is not a far 
                        stretch to say they likely apply to all metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical systems as well. 
                        If this is the case, this is an important reminder to remain humble, understand there will always 
                        be open questions, things will never be fully and satisfactorily resolved. This is not a message of 
                        nihilism but one of hope and motivation.

                        The influences of the ideas of these people have been instrumental in bringing me to the place I am 
                        intellectually. I have a natural desire to learn and understand things but I know there is always 
                        the possibility of being wrong. Mathematical modeling has become a great love of mine for this 
                        reason. The idea that it is theoretically possible that we can perfectly model a given system yet 
                        have no certain idea we have done so has philosophical implications that I get a hint of but have no 
                        idea how to express. It just creates a sense of awe and wonder. Being able to describe 
                        metaphysically a perfect model as the absolute knowing of an object from the world of the abstract 
                        Forms is what prevents me from giving up in attempting to do so. It is a seemingly impossible task 
                        but it is a teleological one that requires the input of others, the progression of me as a scientist, 
                        and at larger scales years researchers and thinkers pushing knowledge as we know it from something it 
                        was to one step closer to what it should be.
