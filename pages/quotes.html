                        At the beginning of the journey to the next world, one's education and culture can 
                        either provide the greatest assistance, or else act as the greatest burden, to the 
                        person who has just died.”

                        lover of myths and poetic fables. Poets and philosophers are alike in being big

                        truths, this reality must be grounded in something existent and actual, and 
                        consequently, it must be grounded in the existence of the necessary being,

                        something outside him and in the offing, on which he depends, without his 
                        having made this foreign world for himself and therefore without being at 
                        home in it by himself as in something his own. The impulse of curiosity, the 
                        pressure for knowledge, from the lowest level up to the highest rung of 
                        philosophical insight arises only from the struggle to cancel this situation 
                        of unfreedom and to make the world one's own in one's ideas and thought.”

                        the former is refuted by the latter; in the same way when the fruit comes, 
                        the blossom may be explained to be a false form of the plant’s existence, 
                        for the fruit appears as its true nature in place of the blossom. The 
                        ceaseless activity of their own inherent nature makes these stages moments 
                        of an organic unity, where they not merely do not contradict one another, 
                        but where one is as necessary as the other; and constitutes thereby the life 
                        of the whole.”

                        conceal the inner world, there is nothing to be seen unless we go behind 
                        it ourselves, as much in order that we may see, as that there may be 
                        something behind there which can be seen.”

                        arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there are statements of 
                        the language of F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F.”
